# Leetcode-solution
# 150 stack easy
## in python, "//" means the floor and int() means discard decimal part.

# 1 hash easy
## dictionary is a data structure implemented based on a hash table.

# 15 hash medium O(n^2)
## Enumerating the element a in list, this problem becomes a sub-question: to find b+c = -a.
## output is required and to be ordered, so we need to order input list at first.
## tips: set() is an unordered collection of unique elements.

# 100 binary_tree easy O(min(n,m)) 
## recursive solution, the key si to analyze the situations in which p or q is None.
## 'self' is a reference to the object itself. 'self' represents the instance of the class on which the method is called. We need to use self.isSameTree() instead of isSameTree() because it's a instant method within the 'Solution' class.
## p: Optional[Treenode] is a part of python type hint, p is name; Optional means p can be Treenode or None.
## --> bool: is a part of type hint, it means this function returns bool value.
